                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The Pomodoro Technique (also known as the Tomato Technique) is
                  a revolutionary time management method developed by Francesco
                  Cirillo in the late 1980s. Named after the tomato-shaped
                  kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student, this
                  method breaks work into focused 25-minute intervals
                  (pomodoros) separated by 5-minute breaks. After completing
                  four pomodoros, you take a longer 15-30 minute break. This
                  scientifically-backed 25/5 timing structure creates the
                  perfect balance between focused work and mental recovery.

                  The Pomodoro Effect on Your Brain
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The Pomodoro effect refers to the profound impact this timing
                  method has on cognitive performance. When you work with our
                  Pomodoro timer, your brain enters a state of heightened focus
                  during the 25-minute work intervals, knowing a break is
                  coming. The brief 5-minute breaks prevent mental fatigue
                  before it begins, allowing you to maintain peak cognitive
                  performance for longer periods. This rhythmic alternation
                  between focus and rest aligns perfectly with your brain's
                  natural attention cycles.

                  The Science Behind the 25/5 Pomodoro Timing
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The 25/5 minute ratio used in the Pomodoro technique isn't
                  arbitrary - it's carefully calibrated to work with your
                  brain's attention span. Research in cognitive psychology shows
                  that most people can maintain peak focus for about 25 minutes
                  before attention begins to wane. The 5-minute break provides
                  just enough time for your brain to refresh without losing the
                  context of your work. This scientifically optimized timing is
                  why the Pomodoro technique remains one of the most effective
                  productivity methods worldwide.

                  How to Maximize the Tomato Technique
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  For best results with our Tomato Technique timer, start by
                  planning your tasks before beginning the Pomodoro cycles.
                  During the 25-minute focus periods, commit to working on only
                  one task without switching. Use the 5-minute breaks for
                  physical movement or brief mental rest (not checking emails or
                  social media). The longer breaks after four cycles are perfect
                  for more substantial refreshment like a walk, healthy snack,
                  or brief meditation. Many users find their productivity peaks
                  between the second and fourth Pomodoro of a session.

                      Why is it called the "Pomodoro" or "Tomato" technique?
                    </h4>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 mt-2">
                      The name comes from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that
                      Francesco Cirillo used when developing the technique as a
                      university student. "Pomodoro" is the Italian word for
                      tomato. Today, digital Pomodoro timers like ours have
                      replaced physical tomato timers, but the name and core
                      25/5 timing method remain the same.

                      Can I adjust the 25/5 timing intervals?
                    </h4>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 mt-2">
                      While the classic Pomodoro technique uses 25-minute work
                      intervals with 5-minute breaks, some people benefit from
                      slight adjustments. If you find yourself consistently
                      losing focus before 25 minutes, you might try 20-minute
                      intervals. Conversely, if you're regularly in a state of
                      flow at the 25-minute mark, you might extend to 30
                      minutes. However, most productivity experts recommend
                      keeping breaks at 5 minutes to prevent losing momentum.

                      What should I do during the Pomodoro breaks?
                    </h4>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 mt-2">
                      Short 5-minute breaks work best when you physically move
                      away from your work area. Stand up, stretch, hydrate, or
                      do quick breathing exercises. Avoid digital screens during
                      these breaks to give your eyes rest. For the longer 15-30
                      minute breaks after four pomodoros, take a walk, have a
                      light snack, practice brief meditation, or engage in a
                      completely different activity that refreshes your mind.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 mt-2">
                      Most people find that 8-12 pomodoros (about 4-6 hours of
                      focused work) per day is optimal. Beyond this, diminishing
                      returns tend to set in. Remember that the power of the
                      Pomodoro technique lies in its intensity - it's better to
                      complete 8 fully focused pomodoros than 16 with divided
                      attention. Track your productivity to find your personal

                    <p className="text-gray-300 mt-2">
                      Unlike simple time blocking or general time management
                      techniques, the Pomodoro method specifically incorporates
                      structured breaks and has a defined work-to-rest ratio.
                      The technique also emphasizes complete focus during work
                      intervals - no multitasking or interruptions. This strict
                      alternation between intensive focus and complete breaks
                      creates a rhythm that trains your brain for deep work,
                      making it more effective than less structured approaches.
